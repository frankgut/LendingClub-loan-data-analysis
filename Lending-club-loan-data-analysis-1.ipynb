    "**Without doing much data preparation, feature selection, and only using sklearn classifier with default parameters, I could already achieve nearly perfect accuracy in classifying between good and bad loans for this dataset. This makes me think that there might be one or several features that have clear indications of borrowers' loan status.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**After reading through all of the column descriptions in the dataset, I noticed a column with the name 'total_rec_prncp'(total received principle). Principle means the amount of money borrowed (excluding interest) in a loan. A low total received principle indicates that the lender will not likely be paid back. One can naively assume this represents a bad loan. As a matter of fact, this is probably how lending club determines whether a loan is charged off or not for most of the cases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To test my thought on this issue, I run a classifier using a dataset with only three columns selected from the whole dataset: 'loan_amnt', 'loan_status', and 'total_rec_prncp'. 'loan_amnt' is basically the principle. 'loan_status' tells us whether a loan is bad or good. After performing the train-test data split, I fit the training data with a logistic regression classifier with cross-validation from sklearn. The precision and recall for the prediction on the test data are shockingly good. The plot below shows the data and decision boundaries to demonstrate a pretty clear cut between the good and bad loans.**\n"

    "**There are many methods that you can transform categorical features into numerical variables. A very good article has discussed several common methods and has done a comparison between them. See (http://www.willmcginnis.com/2015/11/29/beyond-one-hot-an-exploration-of-categorical-variables/). The author has developed a set of scikit-learn-style transformers for encoding categorical variables into numeric with different techniques (http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/). I am going to use it here.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**I am usually against the ordinal coding, in which we just assign an integer to each category. It is appealing that this method does not add any extra dimensions to the problem. However, by doing this, it implies an order to the variable that may not actually exist. I did this for the 'employment length' feature as there is an order among those variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another method I usually end up using is the 'one-hot coding', which can be achieved by applying 'get_dummies' function in Pandas. In this problem, we still have 'term', 'grade', 'addr_state','home_ownership', 'purpose' that are categorical features. Especially for the 'addr_state', if we use the 'one-hot coding' method, we will end up with an extra 48 features (Since this column covers most of the states in the US). The 'purpose' column would add another 13 features. Higher dimensions usually mean we need to fit parameters in a more complex space. It could slow down algorithms or even make them unsolvable.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**I will try the binary encoding in this problem. It will add fewer dimensions than the one-hot coding and may provide better results in general.**"

Recall that when we split the train, test sets, we have calculated the percentiles of good loans and bad loans in our dataset. 85.21% of the dataset are good loans and the rest are bad.  A very naive model in which we predict every loan is good would give us 85.21% accuracy already. In all the models we have tried above, only SVC, GradientBoosting, and LogisticRegressionCV came close to that number. Granted that I was only using the default parameters to train the models, still, this could mean that all of my model choices are bad, choice of features is poor or there isn't too many useful information to enable us to make predictions convincingly.**\n",

    "**The learning curve is a good tool to check whether a machine learning model is overfitting or underfitting. Surprisingly, both AdaBoost and Random Forest started underfitting the training dataset, but the good news is the learning curves gradually converge with the cross-validation scores as the training examples increase. On the other hand, Gradient Boosting overfits the training set at first, then converge with the cross-validation score. So the parameters tuning for adaboost, random forest, and gradient boosting were somewhat successful (Not saying the prediction scores are good, but this is probably the best these models can do). However, SVC still overfits the training set (achieving the perfect score all the time) and never converge with the cross-validation score. Thus, further tunning of the parameters are needed in the future.** "

    "**Random forest and Gradient boosting both consider 'interest rate,  grade, annual income, term length' as their top 4 most important indicators for the loan status. This is consistent with my findings earlier that higher interest rate and lower grade would more likely result in bad loans. The percentage of bad loans is higher among the longer loan term. I was not so sure that the slight difference in the median annual income between good and bad loans is that indicative. However, gradient boosting thinks this is important. Personally, I would agree more with the ranking from 'Random forest'. Loan amount is actually less useful in determining the loan status as one might think. The same goes for the borrowers' address state. On  the other hand, features like 'home ownership, employment length, number of accounts etc' are far less importance according to the models. This is also not too surprising as we have discussed before.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**AdaBoost ranks the feature importance in a way a little different from the other two. Although it also thinks the interest rate and annual income as two of the most important ones, it ranks features like 'purpose', 'address state' much higher than the other two methods. On the other hand, it does not even take 'grade' and 'loan amount' into consideration. Despite ranking features a little differently, AdaBoost achieves similar cross-validation score with others, and in fact, it produces the best prediction on the test dataset by a small margin.**"

However, as I have discussed at the beginning of section 4.3, all trained models could not produce much better results than the baseline accuracy. After excluding features like 'total received principles' that could cause a potential data leakage problem, there are not too many useful information that could help us predict loan status with high accuracy. I might try other methods like XGBoost etc., and further tune the SVC in the future for the sake of learning and practicing. I will try to update this notebook as soon as I have new results.**"
